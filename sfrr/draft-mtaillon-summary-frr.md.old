--- abstract

This document defines RSVP-TE signaling extensions that reduce the
amount of RSVP signaling required for Fast Reroute (FRR) procedures
and subsequently improve the scalability of the RSVP-TE signaling
when undergoing FRR convergence post a link or node failure.  Such
extensions allow the RSVP message exchange between the Point of Local
Repair (PLR) and the Merge Point (MP) to be independent of the number
of protected LSPs traversing between them (eg. when bypass LSP FRR
protection is used). The new signaling extensions are fully backwards
compatible with nodes that do not support them.

# Introduction

FRR procedures defined in {{!RFC4090}} describe the
mechanisms for the PLR to reroute traffic and
signaling of a protected RSVP-TE LSP onto the bypass tunnel in the
event of a TE link or node failure. Such signaling procedures
are performed individually for each affected protected LSP. This may eventually
lead to control plane scalability and latency issues under limited
(memory and processing) resources
after failure that affects a large number of protected LSPs
traversing the same PLR and MP.

In a large RSVP-TE LSPs scale deployment, a single P node acting as a PLR may host tens
of thousands of protected RSVP-TE LSPs egressing the same link, and
likewise, act as a Merge Point (MP) for similar number of LSPs
ingressing the same link. In the event of the failure of the link or
neighbor node, the RSVP-TE control plane of the node acting as PLR becomes busy
rerouting protected LSPs signaling over the bypass tunnel(s) in one
direction. In addition, its control plane acting as MP becomes
busy merging RSVP states signaling received over bypass tunnels in the opposite direction.
At the same time, the head-end PE nodes that are notified of the
local repair at downstream P nodes, will attempt to (re)converge
affected RSVP-TE LSPs onto newly computed paths --
possibly traversing the same previously affected P node(s). As a result, the RSVP-TE control
plane at the PLR and MP becomes overwhelmed by the amount of FRR RSVP-TE processing
overhead following the link or node failure, and the competing other control plane protocol(s) (e.g. the IGP)
that undergo their convergence at the same time.

The extensions defined in this document enable an MP to become aware
of the PLR's bypass assignment and allow FRR procedures between PLR
and MP to be signaled and processed on groups of LSPs.  Further,
MESSAGE_ID objects for the rerouted PATH and RESV states are
exchanged a-priori to the fault such that Summary Refresh
procedures defined in {{!RFC2961}} can continue to be used
to refresh the rerouted state(s) after FRR has occurred.


## Terminology

In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
"SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
{{RFC2119}}.

# Summary FRR Signaling Procedures

@@@@ This document defines two new subobjects (IPv4 and IPv6
SUMMARY_FRR_BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT subobjects) in RSVP RECORD_ROUTE object
to coordinate bypass tunnel assignment between the PLR and MP. @@@@@
These new subobjects are backward compatible with LSRs that
do not recognize them (see section 4.4.5 in {{!RFC3209}}). 
The document also defines a new RSVP SUMMARY_FRR_BYPASS_ACTIVE object
that is sent within an
RSVP Path message to inform the MP that one or more groups of protected
LSPs that are being protected by the bypass tunnel are being rerouted.

The PLR creates and manages Summary FRR LSP groups
(Bypass_Group_Identifiers)  and shares them with the MP via
signaling. Protected LSPs sharing the same egress link and bypass
assignment are grouped together and are assigned the same group.  The
MP maintains the PLR group assignments learned via signaling, and
acknowledges the group assignments via signaling. Once the PLR
receives the acknowledgment, FRR signaling can proceed as group based.

The SUMMARY_FRR_BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT RRO subobject is used to inform the MP of
the bypass tunnel being used by the PLR, the assigned Summary FRR
Bypass_Group_Identifier for the protected LSP, and the MESSAGE_ID
object that the PLR will use to refresh the protected LSP PATH state
post FRR trigger.  When used within a RSVP Resv message, the
SUMMARY_FRR_BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT subobject is used by the MP to
acknowledge the PLR's bypass tunnel assignment, and provide the
MESSAGE_ID object that the MP will use to refresh the protected LSP
RESV state post FRR trigger (and also indicates support for this
extension).

## Signaling Procedures Prior to Failure

   Before Summary FRR procedures can be used, a handshake MUST be
   completed between the PLR and MP.  This handshake is performed using
   RECORD_ROUTE SUMMARY_FRR_BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT subobject within both the
   RSVP Path and Resv messages.

         Type: 8 bits

               (TBD-2) IPv6 Summary FRR Bypass Assignment 

         Length: 8 bits

               The Length contains the total length of the subobject in 
         bytes, including the Type and Length fields.


         Bypass_Tunnel_ID: 16 bits

               The bypass tunnel identifier.


         Bypass_Source_IPv6_Address: 128 bits

               The bypass tunnel source IPV4 address.

 
         Bypass_Destination_IPv6_Address: 128 bits

               The bypass tunnel destination IPV4 address.


         Bypass_Group_Identifier: 32 bits

               The bypass tunnel group identifier.


         Summary_FRR_MESSAGE_ID

               A MESSAGE_ID object as defined by {{!RFC2961}}.


   The PLR assigns a bypass tunnel and Bypass_Group_Identifier for each
   protected LSP.  The same Bypass_Group_Identifier is used for the set
   of protected LSPs that share the same bypass tunnel and traverse the
   same egress link and are not already rerouted.  The PLR also
   generates a MESSAGE_ID object (flags SHOULD be clear, Epoch and
   Message_Identifier MUST be set according to {{!RFC2961}})
   that is used by the PLR to later match the last sent subobject and
   eliminate timing issues.

   The PLR MUST generate a new Message_Identifier each time the
   SUMMARY_FRR_BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT subobject contents change;  for
   example, when PLR changes the bypass tunnel assignment.  

   The PLR notifies the MP of the bypass tunnel assignment via adding a
   SUMMARY_FRR_BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT subobject to the RSVP Path message
   RECORD_ROUTE object for the protected LSP using procedure described
   in section 2.2.1. 

   The MP acknowledges the PLR's assignment by signalling a
   SUMMARY_FRR_BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT subobject within the RSVP Resv messsage
   RECORD_ROUTE object.  With exception of the MESSAGE_ID object, all
   other fields of the received SUMMARY_FRR_BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT subobject
   are copied into the SUMMARY_FRR_BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT of the Resv
   message. The MESSAGE_ID object is set according to {{!RFC2961}}
   with the Flags being clear.  A new Message_Identifier MUST
   be used to acknowledge an updated PLR assignment.

   The PLR considers the protected LSP as Summary FRR capable only if
   the SUMMARY_FRR_BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT subobjects within the sent RSVP
   Path message RECORD_ROUTE and the received RSVP Resv message
   RECORD_ROUTE match (with exception of the MESSAGE_ID object). If a
   matching subobject does not exist, or is later absent in a subsequent
   refresh, the PLR MUST consider the protected LSP as not Summary FRR
   capable.  


### PLR Summary FRR Signaling Procedure 

   The SUMMARY_FRR_BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT subobject is added to the
   RECORD_ROUTE object by each PLR in the RSVP Path message of the
   protected LSP to record the bypass tunnel assignment. This subobject
   is updated every time the PLR updates the bypass tunnel assignment
   (which triggers an RSVP Path change message). Upon updating the
   SUMMARY_FRR_BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT subobject, the PLR MUST consider the
   protected LSP as not Summary FRR capable until a new handshake has
   completed.

   The SUMMARY_FRR_BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT subobject is added in the
   RECORD_ROUTE object prior to adding the node's IP address. An
   implementation may choose to also add the interface IPv4/IPv6 address
   sub-object after the node's IP address.
   A node MUST NOT add a SUMMARY_FRR_BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT subobject without also
   adding the node's IPv4 or IPv6 subobject.

   Upon receiving an RSVP Resv message with RECORD_ROUTE object, the PLR
   checks if the expected SUMMARY_FRR_BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT subobject is
   present.  If present, the PLR determines if the MP has acknowledged
   the current PLR assignment.

   To be a valid acknowledgement, the received
   SUMMARY_FRR_BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT subobject within the Resv message MUST
   match the latest SUMMARY_FRR_BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT subobject sent with
   the Path message (with exception of the MESSAGE_ID) and the received
   Message_Identifier MUST be different (to prevent race condition
   during bypass assignment flip-flop).  If the MP has acknowledged the
   bypass assignment then the LSP is now ready for Summary FRR.  

   When forwarding an RSVP Resv message upstream, the PLR MAY remove
   any/all SUMMARY_FRR_BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT subobjects with a matching
   Bypass_Source_Address.

### MP Summary FRR Signaling Procedure

   Upon receiving an RSVP Path message with RECORD_ROUTE object, the MP
   processes all (there may be multiple PLRs for a single MP)
   SUMMARY_FRR_BYPASSS_ASSIGNMENT subobjects with a matching Bypass
   Destination address.  

   The MP first ensures the existence of the bypass tunnel and that the
   Bypass_Group_Identifier is not already active.  That is, an LSP
   cannot join a group that is already active.

   The MP builds a mirrored Summary FRR Group database per PLR, which is
   determined using the Bypass_Source_Address field.  The MESSAGE_ID is
   extracted and recorded for the protected LSP PATH state. To
   acknowledge each PLR bypass assignment, a matching
   SUMMARY_FRR_BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT subobject is prepared as per 2.2.
   Note, an MP may received more than a Path message with the
   SUMMARY_FRR_BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT subobject from different upstream PLRs.
   In this case, the MP is expected to save all the received 
   MESSAGE_IDs from the different PLRs. Post failure, the MP determines
   and activates the associated Sumamry Refresh ID to use once it
   receives and processes the SUMMARY_FRR_BYPASS_ACTIVE from the PLR.

   Each SUMMARY_FRR_BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT subobject is added in the
   RECORD_ROUTE object prior to adding the node's IP address. An
   implementation may choose to also add the interface IPv4/IPv6 address
   sub-object after the node's IP address. A node
   MUST NOT add a SUMMARY_FRR_BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT subobject without also
   adding an IPv4 or IPv6 subobject.

   When forwarding an RSVP Path message downstream, the MP MAY remove
   any/all SUMMARY_FRR_BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT subobjects with a matching
   Bypass_Destination_Address.

## Signaling Procedures Post Failure {#post-failure}

   Upon detection of the fault (egress link or node failure) the PLR
   first performs the object modification procedures described by
   section 6.4.3 of {{RFC4090}} for all affected protected LSPs. For
   Summary FRR LSPs assigned to the same bypass tunnel a common RSVP_HOP
   and SENDER_TEMPLATE MUST be used. 

   The PLR MUST signal non-Summary FRR LSPs over the bypass tunnel
   before signaling the Summary FRR LSPs.  This is needed to allow for
   the case when the PLR has recently changed a bypass assignment which
   the MP may not have processed the change yet. 

   A new object SUMMARY_FRR_BYPASS_ACTIVE is defined and sent within the
   RSVP Path message of the bypass tunnel for reroute signaling of
   Summary FRR LSPs.

### SUMMARY_FRR_BYPASS_ACTIVE object

   The SUMMARY_FRR_BYPASS_ACTIVE object is sent within an RSVP Path message
   to inform the MP (bypass tunnel destination) that one
   or more groups of protected LSPs that are being protected by the
   bypass tunnel are being rerouted.

   The SUMMARY_FRR_BYPASS_ACTIVE object has the following format:

      SUMMARY_FRR_BYPASS_ACTIVE Class = (TBD-3) (of the form 11bbbbbb)

      Class = SUMMARY_FRR_BYPASS_ACTIVE Class, C_Type = (TBD-4)

       0                   1                   2                   3

      |                       Bypass_Group_Identifier                 |

      |                                 :                             |
      //                                :                            //

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                       Bypass_Group_Identifier                 |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

      RSVP_HOP_Object: Class 3, as defined by {{!RFC2205}}]

          Replacement HOP object to be applied to all LSPs associated
      with each of the following Bypass_Group_Identifiers

      Bypass_Group_Identifier: 32 bits

          Bypass_Group_Identifier field from the RECORD_ROUTE object
      SUMMARY_FRR_BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT subobject(s) corresponding to all
      LSPs that the bypass headend (PLR) advertised this specific
      Bypass_Group_Identifier for.  One or more
      Bypass_Group_Identifiers may be included.

### PLR Summary FRR Signaling Procedure {#plr-sfrr}

   Post a failure event, when using the Summary FRR path signalling procedures,
   an individual RSVP Path message for each Summary FRR LSP is not signaled.
   Instead, to reroute Summary FRR LSPs via the bypass tunnel, the PLR adds the
   SUMMARY_FRR_BYPASS_ACTIVE object in the RSVP Path message of the
   RSVP session of the bypass tunnel.  
 
   The RSVP_HOP_Object field of the SUMMARY_FRR_BYPASS_ACTIVE object is
   set to the common RSVP_HOP that was used by the PLR in [ ](#post-failure).

   The previously received MESSAGE_ID from the MP is activated. As a result,
   the MP may refresh the protected rerouted RESV state using
   Summary Refresh procedures.

   For each affected Summary FRR group, its group identifier is added to
   the SUMMARY_FRR_BYPASS_ACTIVE object.

### MP Summary FRR Signaling Procedure

   Upon receiving an RSVP Path message with a SUMMARY_FRR_BYPASS_ACTIVE
   object, the MP performs normal merging processing for each LSP
   associated with each Bypass_Group_Identifier, as if it received
   individual RSVP Path messages for each Summary FRR LSP.

   For each Summary FRR LSP being merged, the MP first modifies the Path
   state as follows:

1. The RSVP_HOP object is copied from the SUMMARY_FRR_BYPASS_ACTIVE RSVP_HOP_Object field.

2. The SENDER_TEMPLATE object SrcAddress field is copied from the bypass tunnel SENDER_TEMPLATE object. For the case where PLR is
      also the headend, and SENDER_TEMPLATE SrcAddress of the protected LSP and bypass tunnel are the same, the MP MUST use the modified
      HOP Hop Address field instead.

3. The ERO object is modified as per section 6.4.4. of {{RFC4090}}.
   Once the above modifications are completed, the MP then performs the
   merge processing as per {{RFC4090}}. 

4. The previously received MESSAGE_ID from the PLR is activated, meaning
   that the PLR may now refresh the protected rerouted PATH state using
   Summary Refresh procedures.

A failure during merge processing of any individual rerouted LSP MUST
result in an RSVP Path Error message and the LSP MUST NOT be removed
from the Bypass_Group -- this is to cover the case where the RSVP
Path Error message doesn't reach the PLR and the RSVP Path Error
message may need to be resignaled. 

An individual RSVP Resv message for each successfully merged Summary
FRR LSP is not signaled.  The MP SHOULD immediately use Summary
Refresh to refresh the protected LSP RESV state.

## Refreshing Summary FRR Active LSPs

   Refreshing of Summary FRR active LSPs is performed using Summary
   Refresh as defined by {{RFC2961}}.

# Compatibilty

   The new SUMMARY_FRR_BYPASS_ACTIVE object is to be defined with a
   class number in the form 11bbbbbb, which ensures compatibility with
   non- supporting nodes. Per {{!RFC2205}}, nodes not supporting this
   extension will ignore the object but forward it, unexamined and
   unmodified, in all messages.

   The new SUMMARY_FRR_BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT RECORD_ROUTE subobject, as per
   section 4.4.5. of {{RFC3209}}, if not recognized SHOULD be ignored and
   forwarded.  

# Security Considerations

   This document introduces new RSVP subobjects, and one new RSVP object.
   Thus in the event of
   the interception of a signaling message, slightly more could be
   deduced about the state of the network than was previously the case.


# IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to administer assignment of new values for the
   namespace defined in this document and summarized in this section.
   IANA maintains and assigns the values for RSVP-TE protocol parameters
   "Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) Parameters" (see
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/rsvp-parameters).
